    <div class='ph4'>(<i>A Sketch at the Casino, Dinard.</i>)</div>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>On either side of the circular Race-course, with its
        revolving metal horses, is a Green Table, divided into
        numbered squares, around which the Players, who are mostly
        English, are sitting or standing. A Croupier with his rake
        presides at each table. In an obscure corner of the balcony
        outside</i>, Miss DAINTREE <i>and her</i> Married Sister
        <i>have just established themselves. There is a Ball at the
        Casino, and the Orchestra are heard tuning up for the next
        dance.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Married Sister.</i> But SYLVIA, why have you
        dragged me out here to sit in the dark? I thought you were
        engaged for this?</p>

        <p><i>Miss Daintree.</i> So I am—to such a horrid
        little man. That’s why I fled. He won’t think of coming
        <i>here</i> after me!</p>

        <p><i>The M.S.</i> What made you give him a dance at
        all?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> JACK brought him up to me—so
        naturally I thought he was a dear friend of his, but it
        seems he only sat next to him at <i>table d’hôte</i>, and
        JACK says he pestered him so for an introduction, he
        <i>had</i> to do it—to get rid of him. So like a
        brother, wasn’t it?... Oh, AMY, he’s
        <i>coming</i>—what <i>shall</i> I do? I know he can’t
        dance a little bit! I watched him trying.</p>

        <p><i>The M.S.</i> Can’t you ask him to sit it out?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> That’s <i>worse</i>! Let’s hope he won’t
        notice us.—Ah—he <i>has</i>!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Mr. CUBSON, <i>a podgy young man with small eyes and a
        scrubby moustache, wearing a tailless evening-coat and a
        wrinkled white waistcoat, advances.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mr. Cubson.</i> Our dance, I believe? (<i>The
        Orchestra strikes up.</i>) Isn’t that the <i>Pas de
        Quatre?</i> To tell you the truth, I’m not very well up in
        these new steps, so I shall trust to you to pull me
        through—soon get into it, y’know.</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). If I could only get
        <i>out</i> of it! (<i>She rises with a look of mute appeal
        to her</i> Sister.) We can go through this room. (<i>They
        pass into the Salle des Petits Chevaux.</i>) Stop one
        minute—I just want to see which horse wins. Don’t you
        call this a fascinating game?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Well, I don’t understand the way they play
        it here—too complicated for <i>me</i>, you know!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Anything to gain
        time! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, it’s quite simple—you just
        put your money down on any number you choose, and say
        “<i>Sur le</i>”—whatever it is, and, if it wins, you
        get seven times your stake.</p>

        <p><i>Croupier.</i> Tous sont payés—faites vos jeux,
        Messieurs,—les jeux sont partis!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> I know what I should do—I should
        back 7 this time. I’ve a presentiment he’ll win.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Then why don’t you back him?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Because I don’t happen to have brought
        any money with me.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Oh, I daresay I can accommodate you with a
        franc or two, if that’s all.</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Thank you, I won’t trouble you: but do
        back him yourself, just to see if I’m not right.</p>

        <p><i>Croupier.</i> Les jeux sont faits. Rien ne va
        plus!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> (<i>throwing a franc on the table</i>).
        Sur le sept! (<i>To</i> Miss D.) I say, he’s raked it in.
        What’<i>s that</i> for?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> For the Bank, or Charity, or
        something—they always do that if you stake too
        late.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Swindle, <i>I</i> call it. And I should
        have won, too—it <i>is</i> 7. I’ve had enough of
        this—suppose we go and dance?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Why, you’re not going to give in
        already—after so nearly winning, too?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah, well, I’ll have just one more
        go—and then we’ll be off. I’m going to try the 9 this
        time. [<i>He stakes.</i></p>

        <p><i>Miss D. I</i> should have gone on the 4—it’s
        time one of the even numbers won again.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Oh, would you? All right, then. (<i>To</i>
        Cr.) Pas sur le neuf—le quatre. (<i>The</i> Croupier
        <i>transfers the franc to 4.</i>) They’re off—can’t
        tell the winner yet. Now they’re slower—4’s
        good—4’s very good. See where he’s stopped, not an
        inch from the post! This isn’t half a bad game.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>A horse with a red flag at his head, labelled No. 9,
        creeps slowly up, and stops just ahead of 4.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Croupier.</i> Neuf, impair, et rouge!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> It’s 9 after all—and I backed him
        first. (<i>In an injured tone.</i>) I should have
        <i>won</i> if you hadn’t said that about 4!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> (<i>with secret delight</i>). I won’t
        advise any more. What are you going to back?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> We really ought to be dancing—but
        I’ll try my luck once more on No. 4. I shall put on
        <i>two</i> francs this time.</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Shall you? How reckless! I heard someone
        say just now that No. 1 hasn’t won for a long time.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> I took your advice once too often.
        There—4’s going to win—see how he’s going
        round—no, he’s passed.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>A horse with a yellow flag, labelled No. 1, stops
        close to the post.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Croupier.</i> L’As, impair, et jaune!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Didn’t I tell you so?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> You only said <i>I hadn’t</i>
        won—not that he <i>would</i>. If you had spoken more
        plainly—! I don’t think much of <i>this</i>
        game—I’ve dropped four francs already. How about that
        dance?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> (<i>ironically</i>). It would be rather a
        pity to go away without getting all that money back,
        wouldn’t it?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> (<i>seriously</i>). Perhaps it would.
        You’re sure you’re in no hurry about this dance?</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> On the contrary!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Well, look here, I’m going to put on a
        five-franc piece this time—so be careful what you
        advise.</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Oh, I really couldn’t undertake such a
        responsibility.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> I shall follow this man then, and back
        five. (<i>He does; the horses spin round, and the race is
        won by a horse with a tricoloured flag labelled No. 5.</i>)
        There, I’ve done it without you, you see. (<i>The</i>
        Croupier <i>pushes a heap of ivory counters towards him,
        which he takes up with trembling hands.</i>) I say, I
        scooped in thirty-five francs over that! Not bad, is it?
        I’m glad I waited!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Yes, it’s better fun than dancing, isn’t
        it?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Oh, lots—at least I didn’t mean
        <i>that</i> quite—</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Didn’t you? <i>I</i> did. What are you
        going to back next?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Well, I must just have one more turn, and
        then we’ll go and get that dance over. I’m going to plunge
        this time. (<i>He spreads his counters about the
        board.</i>) There, I’ve put five francs on each colour and
        ten each on 8 and 9. You see, by hedging like that, you’re
        bound to pull off <i>something</i>!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> (<i>as the horses spin round</i>). All
        the yellow flags are out of it.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Doesn’t matter, 9’s red, and he’s going
        first-rate—nothing to beat him!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> Unless it’s 5, and then you lose.
        (<i>No.</i> 5 <i>wins again.</i>) How unfortunate for you.
        5 generally <i>does</i> win twice running, somehow.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> (<i>with reproach</i>). If you had thought
        of that a little sooner, I shouldn’t have lost twenty
        francs! (<i>A player rises, and</i> Mr. C. <i>secures the
        vacant chair.</i>) More comfortable sitting down. I must
        get that back before I go. I’ve got about twenty francs
        left, I’ll put five on yellow, and ten on 9. (<i>He
        does.</i> Croupier. “<i>Deux, pair, et rouge!</i>”) Only
        five left! I’ll back yellow again, as red won last. (<i>He
        does.</i> Croupier. “<i>Quatre, pair, et rouge!</i>” <i>He
        turns to</i> Miss D. <i>for sympathy.</i>) I say, did you
        ever see such beastly bad—? <i>A Frenchman</i>
        (<i>behind him</i>). Plaît-il? <i>Mr. C.</i>
        (<i>confused</i>). Oh, rien. I wasn’t speaking to
        <i>you</i>, M’soo. (<i>To himself.</i>) Where on earth has
        that girl got to? She might have waited! She’s gone back to
        the balcony! (<i>He goes out in pursuit of her.</i>) Oh, I
        say, Miss—er—DAINTREE, if you’re ready for that
        “<i>Pas de Quatre</i>,” I am. Hope I haven’t kept you
        waiting.</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> (<i>sweetly</i>). Not’ in the very least.
        Are you sure you’ve <i>quite</i> finished playing?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> As I’ve lost all I’d won and a lot on the
        top of that, I should rather think I <i>had</i> finished
        playing.</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> So has the Orchestra—quite a
        coincidence, isn’t it? You were so absorbed, you
        see!—No, I won’t keep you out here, thanks; my sister
        will take care of me.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.</i> (<i>to himself, as he departs rather
        sheepishly</i>). I’ve <i>offended</i> that girl—I
        could see she was wild at missing that Barn Dance. I wish I
        <i>had</i> danced it, I’m sure,—it would have saved
        me several francs. It was all her own fault. However, I’ll
        ask her for a waltz another evening, and make it up to her
        <i>that</i> way. Confound those <i>Petits Chevaux</i>!</p>

        <p><i>Miss D.</i> AMY, he’s gone,—and I
        <i>haven’t</i> danced and I haven’t sat out with
        him—and he can’t’ say it’s <i>my</i> fault either!
        (<i>She kisses her hand to the Petits Chevaux inside.</i>)
        Thanks, <i>ever</i> so much, you dear little beasts!</p>

    <p>The Baron pauses in the midst of his varied literary and
    philosophic studies to look into No. 46, Vol. iv., Part ii., of
    <i>Our Celebrities</i>, a publication which has been admirably
    conducted by the late and the present Count ASTRORÓG, which is
    the title, when he is at home, of the eminent photographer and
    proprietor of the Walery-Gallery. First comes life-like
    portrait of the stern Sir EDWARD W. WATKIN, on whose brow Time,
    apparently, writes no wrinkles, though Sir EDWARD could put
    most of us up to a few. Nor, strange to say, are there any
    lines on his countenance, probably because he has so many other
    lines, existing and contemplated, in his eye.</p>

    <p>But ’tis not alone thy inky cloak, good Sir EDWARD, that
    attracts the Baron, nor is it the business-like profile of
    THOMAS DE GREY, sixth Lord Walsingham, Chairman of the Ensilage
    Committee, that gives the Baron matter for special admiration;
    but it is the perfectly charming portrait of “‘DAISY PLESS’
    H.S.H. the Princess HENRY OF PLESS,” which rivets the Baron’s
    attention, and causes him to exclaim, “She <i>is</i> pretty,
    Pless her!” Miss CORNWALLIS WEST, but now a DAISY, now a
    Princess, came up as a flower at Ruthin Castle, and “in 1891
    Prince HENRY OF PLESS,” says the brief narrative written by A.
    BULL (an example of “a bull and no mistake”) “wooed and won the
    beauty of the Season,”—lucky ’ARRY PLESS!—and then
    Prince ’ARRY took his bride to Furstenstein, in Silesia, “a
    fine schloss, with beautiful gardens and terraces,”—in
    short, “a Pleasaunce.” Count ASTRORÓG may do, as he has done,
    many excellent photographic portraits, but this one will be
    uncommonly “hard to beat,” and King of Photographers as he
    seems to be, it is not every day that he has so charming a

    <div class='chapter'><h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2></div>

    <p>LUNCH (<i>continued</i>).—How delightful it is to
    awaken interest in the female breast, to make the heart of
    lovely woman go pit-pat, as her eyes read the words one’s pen
    has written. Even in drawing-rooms and boudoirs, it seems,
    bright eyes have marked these attempts to teach a correct
    conversational manner to those who engage in game-shooting.
    Here is one letter of the hundreds that <i>Mr. Punch</i> has
    one by one pressed to his gallant lips with an emotion that
    might, perhaps, not have been expected from one of his years
    and discretion. But how shall time or caution prevail against
    universal love? The flame burns on with an unquenchable ardour.
    Beautiful beings, the <i>Punch</i> of your affections is true
    to you all. He takes you in a lump and loves you. He takes you
    singly and adores you, passionately but paternally. Here,
    therefore, is the letter:—</p>

    <p>DEAREST MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>We have all been <i>so</i> delighted to read your articles
    about shooting. I read them to Papa after dinner in the
    drawing-room. Mamma says she doesn’t understand such matters;
    but, of course, things have altered <i>very much</i> since her
    young days, as she is always telling us. Now I want to ask your
    opinion about an important point. <i>Do</i> you think girls
    ought to go out and join the men at lunch? We all think it
    <i>so</i> delightful, but FRED, my eldest brother, makes
    himself <i>extremely</i> disagreeable about it—at least
    he did till last week, when EMILY RAYBURN, who is my very
    <i>dearest</i> friend, was staying with us. Then he told me we
    might come for a change, but we were to go home again directly
    afterwards. Generally he says that women are <i>a bore</i> out
    shooting. <i>Please</i> tell us, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, what
    you really think about it.</p>

    <p>With much love, yours always,</p>

    <p class="author">ROSE LARKING.</p>

    <p>P.S.—I am so glad you write the word “lunch,” and not
    “luncheon.” I told FRED that—but he went to <i>Johnson’s
    Dictionary</i>, and read out something about “Lunch” being only
    a colloquial form of “luncheon.” Still, I don’t care a little
    bit. Dr. JOHNSON lived so long ago, and couldn’t possibly know
    <i>everything</i>—could he?</p>

    <p class="author">R.L.</p>

    <p>My darling young lady, I reply, your letter has made a deep
    impression on me. Dr. JOHNSON did, as you say, live many years
    ago; so many years ago, in fact, that (as a little friend of
    <i>Mr. Punch</i> once said, with a sigh, on hearing that
    someone would have been one hundred and fifty years old if he
    had been alive at the present day) he must be “a orfle old
    angel now.” The word “lunch” is short, crisp, and appetising.
    The word “luncheon” is of a certain pomposity, which, though it
    may suit the mansions of the great, is out of place when
    applied to the meals of active sportsmen. So we will continue,
    if you please, to speak of “lunch.” And now for your question.
    My charming ROSE, this little treatise does not profess to do
    anything more than teach young sportsmen how to converse. I
    assume that they have learnt shooting from other instructors.
    And as to the details of shooting-parties, how they should be
    composed, what they should do or avoid, and how they should
    bear themselves generally—the subject is too great, too
    solemn, too noble to be entered upon with a light heart. At any
    rate, that is not my purpose here. It was
    rude—<i>very</i> rude—of FRED to say you were a
    bore—and I am sure it wasn’t true. I can picture you
    tripping daintily along with your pretty companions to the
    lunch <i>rendezvous</i>. You are dressed in a perfectly
    fitting, tailor-made dress, cut short in the skirt, and
    displaying the very neatest and smallest pair of ankles that
    ever were seen. And your dear little nose is just a
    leetle—not red, no, certainly not red, but just
    delicately pink on its jolly little tip, having gallantly
    braved the north wind without a veil. To call <i>you</i> a bore
    is absurd. But men are <i>such</i> brutes, and it is as certain
    as that two and two (even at our public schools) make four,
    that ladies are—what shall I say?—not so popular as
    they always ought to be when they come amongst shooters engaged
    in their sport. Even at lunch they are not <i>always</i>
    welcomed with enthusiasm. This is, perhaps, wrong, for, after
    all, they can do no harm there.</p>

    <p>But, darling ROSE, I am sure FRED was perfectly right to
    send you home again directly the meal was over, though it must
    have wrung his manly heart to part from EMILY RAYBURN. Even, I,
    the veteran sportsman <i>Punch</i>, have qualms when a poor
    bird has been merely wounded, or when a maimed hare shrieks as
    the dog seizes it. I cannot, as I say, discuss the ethics of
    the question. The good shot is the merciful shot. But, after
    all, in killing of every kind, whether by the gun or the
    butcher’s knife, there is an element of cruelty. And therefore,
    my pretty ROSE, <i>you</i> must keep away from the shooting.
    Besides, have I not seen a good shot “tailor” half-a-dozen
    pheasants in succession, merely because a chattering
    lady—not a dear, pleasant little lump of delight like
    you, ROSE—had posted herself beside him, and made him
    nervous? By all means come to lunch if you must, but, equally
    by all means, leave the guns to themselves afterwards. As for
    ladies who themselves shoot, why the best I can wish them is,
    that they should promptly shoot themselves. I can’t abide them.
    Away with them!</p>

    <p>But, in order that the purpose of this work may be
    fulfilled, and the conversational method inculcated, I here
    give a short “Ladies-at-lunch-dialogue,” phonographically
    recorded, as a party of five guns was approaching the place of
    lunch, at about 1:30 P.M.</p>

        <p><i>First Sportsman</i> (<i>addressing his

        <p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>horror—struck.</i>) <i>What?</i>
        The women coming to lunch? No, hang it all, you’re joking.
        Say you are—do!</p>

        <p><i>First Sp.</i> Joking? Not I! I tell you six solid
        women are going to lunch with us. I heard ’em all talking
        about it after breakfast, and thinking it would be,
        <i>oh</i>, such fun! By the way, I suppose you know you’ve
        got a hole in your knickerbockers.</p>

        <p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>looking down, and perceiving a huge and
        undisguisable rent</i>). Good Heavens! so I have. I must
        have done it getting over the last fence. Isn’t it awful? I
        can’t show like this. Have you got any pins?</p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Another Sportsman</i> (<i>bringing up the rear with a
        companion</i>). Hope we shan’t be long over lunch. There’s
        a lot of ground to cover this afternoon, and old SYKES
        tells me they’ve got a splendid head of birds this year, I
        always think—(<i>He breaks off suddenly; an
        expression of intense alarm comes over his face.</i>) Why,
        what’s that? No, it can’t be. Yes, by Jingo, it is. It’s
        the whole blessed lot of women come out to lunch, my wife
        and all. Well, poor thing, she couldn’t help it. Had to
        come with the rest, I suppose.
        <span class="pagenum"><a id='page221'></a>[pg 221]</span> But it’s mean of
           CHALMERS—I swear it is. He ought not to have
           allowed it. And then, never to let on about it to us.
           Well, my day’s spoilt, if they come on with us
           afterwards. I couldn’t shoot an ostrich sitting with a
           woman chattering: to me. Miss CHICKWEED’s got her eye on
           you. LLOYD. She’s marked you. No good trying to do a
           ramp. You’re nailed, my boy, nailed!</p>

        <p><i>Lloyd.</i> Hang Miss CHICKWEED! She half killed me
        last night with all kinds of silly questions. Asked me to
        be sure and bring her home a rocketing rabbit, because
        she’d heard they were very valuable. Why can’t the women
        stay at home?</p>

        us waiting! Now, Captain LLOYD, did you shoot really well?
        Or, were you thinking of—Well, perhaps I oughtn’t to
        say. See how discreet I am. But do tell me, all of you,
        <i>exactly</i> how many birds you shot—I do so like
        to hear about it. You begin, Captain LLOYD. How many did
        you shoot? (<i>Without waiting for an answer.</i>) I’m sure
        you must have shot a dozen. Yes, I guess a dozen. And, oh,
        do give me a feather for my hat! It will be so nice to have
        a <i>real</i> feather to put in it. And we’ve got such a
        treat for you. MARY, you tell them. No, I’ll tell them

    <p>So you got through your labours at Oxford, my dear friend,
    without feeling any ill effects?—Certainly, never enjoyed
    myself more. Everyone paid the deepest attention. One Don
    actually used an ear-trumpet.</p>

    <p>Well, and what do you intend doing next?—Oh, lots of
    things. You see my Parliamentary work is next to
    nothing—not a moment more than ten hours a-day. So I must
    do something with my spare time.</p>

    <p>Certainly, I have no objection. But I should like to hear
    your programme.—I have only got it into form for a week
    or so. Before the end of the year I shall have it ship-shape.
    But say for November. Shall we say November?</p>

    <p>Certainly. What do you propose doing in
    November?—Well, I think I shall retranslate the works of
    HOMER, and write an exhaustive article in the <i>Encylopædia
    Britannica</i> (new edition) on the “Life of WELLINGTON.”</p>

    <p>And that is all? Well, and a fair amount, too!—All!
    What nonsense! Why, that will take me less than no time. Then I
    think I shall ascend Mont Blanc, so as to be able to see how
    the summit looks in winter. Then I shall translate the
    <i>Waverley Novels</i> into Swedish.</p>

    <p>Well, you might be worse employed, but you must not overdo
    it.—Overdo it! Certainly not! Why, I am strong as a
    horse. And that reminds me, I think I shall attempt a
    long-distance ride on my own account. I feel sure that I can do
    better than those German and Austrian fellows.</p>

    <p>Where do you propose to ride?—From John o’ Groat’s to
    the Land’s End, I fancy, will be the course. I ought to do it
    in three days.</p>

    <p>Of course you will use more than one horse?—Oh,
    certainly. No cruelty. And I think I shall try the walk myself
    on foot, just to see if a horse will be able to keep up with
    me.</p>

    <p>And is there any other exploit that you contemplate?—I
    thought I might perhaps dine with the new Lord Mayor.</p>

    <p>What! dine with the new Lord Mayor! Why, you would never be
    able to bear the strain; the great exertion!—I was half
    afraid you might say this, so I have written and respectfully
    declined the invitation!</p>

    <p>His name was LEGION. He had kept his eye on the Laureateship
    from his early boyhood, when he sent verses to the Poets’
    Corner of the <i>Bungay Weekly Mail</i>, which sometimes
    published them; then he cut them out, and pasted them neatly in
    a book, which he still possesses. He always wrote on an
    occasion. “Lines on the Recovery of My Sister EMILY from the
    Mumps”; “Dirge on the Decease of a Favourite Squirrel,”
    beginning, “No more!” but there was always plenty more where
    that came from, and is still. At College he was one of the
    three men who wrote in <i>College Rhymes</i>, and secured for
    that periodical a circulation by taking a hundred copies each.
    LEGION sent dozens of his, marked, to every poet he heard of,
    generally addressing them “Dear ALURED” (if that was the
    Minstrel’s Christian name), or, in verse, “Brother, my Brother,
    my sweet, swift Brother!” This annoyed some poets, who did not
    answer; others were good-natured, and would reply,—</p>

    <p>“DEAR SIR,—I have to acknowledge, with many thanks,
    your <i>Cebren and Paris</i>, and anticipate much pleasure from
    its perusal.”</p>

    <p>LEGION kept all these letters in a book, and published some
    of them as advertisements of his <i>Cebren and Paris</i> (an
    unsuccessful Newdigate), when it appeared in a volume, with an
    astonishingly decorative cover. It was a classical piece, in
    blank verse. Cebren, the father of Œnone, is represented
    asking Paris what his intentions are as regards that lady. It
    was piece of classical <i>genre</i>, the author said: such
    interviews must have occurred when a young Trojan prince, with
    no particular expectations, paid marked attentions to the
    daughter of a River-god, like Cebren. Here is a specimen
    piece,—</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>“Now mark me, Paris,” said the River-god,</p>

            <p>Seated among the damp lush water-weeds,</p>

            <p>His tresses crowned with crow’s-foot,—“Mark my
            words,</p>

            <p>Thou dalliest with my daughter; what thine aim,</p>

            <p>I ask, and crave an answer—great thy line,</p>

            <p>The lineage of renowned Laomedon.</p>

            <p>Thy sires have wedded goddesses ere now.</p>

            <p>But wealthy though the House of Troy may be.</p>

            <p>Thy father has a monstrous family,</p>

            <p>Daughters and sons as countless as the rills</p>

            <p>That Ida sends to be my tributaries.</p>

            <p>What he can give thee, what thy prospects are,</p>

            <p>What settlements thou art prepared to make,</p>

            <p>If thou wouldst lead Œnone to the altar,</p>

            <p>This would I know; excuse an anxious sire!”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then Paris murmured:—</p>

            <p class="i6">“Honourable but vague,</p>

            <p>Remote, but honourable, my purpose is:“</p>

            <p>And that great River-god arose in flood,</p>

            <p>Monstrous, and murmuring, and to the main.</p>

            <p>He swept the works of men and oxen down,</p>

            <p>And had not Paris climbed into a tree,</p>

            <p>He ne’er had crossed the ocean; never seen</p>

            <p>The fairest face that launched a thousand ships,</p>

            <p>And burned the topless towers of Ilium.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Some accused LEGION of plagiarising the last line and a
    half, which reminded them, they said, of MARLOWE. But he
    replied that great wits jump, that it was an accidental
    coincidence. The public, which rarely cares much for poetry,
    was struck by <i>Cebren and Paris</i>. “There is in it,” said
    the <i>Parthenon</i>, “an original music, and a chord is
    struck, reverberating from the prehistoric years, which will
    find an answer in the heart of every father of a family.” The
    Clergy at large quoted <i>Cebren and Paris</i> in their charges
    and sermons, and the work was a favourite prize at seminaries
    for young ladies. Consequently all the other poets, whom nobody
    buys, arose, and blasphemed <i>Cebren and Paris</i> in all the
    innumerable reviews. This greatly, and justly, added to the
    popularity of LEGION’s book. He followed it up by <i>Idylls of
    the Nursery</i>, a volume of exquisite pieces on infants as yet
    incapable of speaking or walking. This had an enormous success
    among young newly-married people, an enthusiastic class of the
    community. At recitations you might hear—</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Tootsy, wootsy, pooty sing,</p>

            <p>Mammie’s darling, icky thing!</p>

            <p>Coral lips that fret the coral,</p>

            <p>Innocence completely moral.</p>

            <p class="i4">Sweet Babe,</p>

            <p class="i6">They say,</p>

            <p class="i2">Naught rhymes to Babe,</p>

            <p class="i6">In any lay</p>

            <p>Save “astrolabe,”—</p>

            <p>And Tippoo Saib!</p>

            <p class="i4">Oh, tiny face,</p>

            <p class="i6">And tiny feet,</p>

            <p class="i4">Oh, infant grace,</p>

            <p class="i6">So incomplete,</p>

            <p class="i2">Kiss me, my Sweet!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In sequence to these effusions, LEGION poured forth
    Ballades, and Rondeaux, and wrote a Chant Royal on a General
    Election which occupied a whole column of a newspaper, and
    needed three men to read, with a boy for the “envoy.” But this
    ditty was not thought to have seriously affected the voting
    classes in any direction. LEGION was now usually spoken of as
    “the versatile Mr. LEGION,” a compliment which never failed to
    annoy him hugely. Sated with popular applause, he turned into a
    vein of new poetry, and produced <i>The Song of the Spud</i>,
    which, his admirers averred was “racy of the soil.” A grand
    English Opera, on the Pilgrimage of Grace, was performed, at
    immense expense, LEGION being the Librettist. It was patriotic,
    but not exactly popular. Still, with all these claims on his
    country, LEGION lived in hopes which were wofully disappointed;
    for, when his chance came at last, a Prime Minister of modern
    ideas declared that, as a Laureate is not useful, he must be
    ornamental. Now, neither LEGION, nor any of his rivals, could
    be called decorative, whatever they might have been in their
    youth. They needed laurels, for the same reason as JULIUS
    CÆSAR. The wreath was therefore offered (by a Plébiscite
    conducted in a newspaper) to the young Lady-poet whose verses
    and photograph secured the greatest number of votes; the
    Laureate, in every case, to resign, on attaining her
    twenty-fifth birthday. The beautiful and accomplished Mrs.
    JINGLEY JONES triumphed in this truly modern competition, and
    her book was rushed into a sale of two hundred and fifty
    copies. After this check the writing of poetry ceased to
    attract male enterprise—to the extreme joy of Publishers
    and Reviewers; though the market for waste-paper received a
    shock from which it never rallied. The youthful male population
    of England determined never to become Poets, unless they were
    born Poets, a resolution on which, at all times, a minority of
    the race had acted, with the best results.</p>

    <p>“NOTES AND PAPER.”—There is a lot of “paper” about
    from “Walker—London.” No, Mr. JOHNNIE TOOLE, Sir, not
    your “paper,” for <i>your</i> House is crammed and your “paper”
    is at a premium. But this particular WALKER, of Warwick House,
    London, sends forth “Society Stationery”—“which,” as
    <i>Mrs. Gamp</i> would have said, “spelling of it with an ‘a’
    instead of an ‘e,’ Society never is.” Among the lot there’s an
    “Antique Society Paper,” which should be a Society Paper as old
    as the world itself, or it might be used by a Fossilised Fogey
    Club. WALKER &amp; Co.’s new “Society Paper,” whether antique
    or modern, is pretty and quite harmless—till pen and ink
    are at work on it; and then—but that’s another story.</p>

        complicated affair a Chancery suit is! I had no idea we
        should have to do all this. But won’t it be very
        expensive?</p>

        <p><i>Sol.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Well, yes; but it will all
        be paid out of the estate. You, my dear lady, won’t have to
        pay anything for it—I mean out of your own
        pocket.</p>

        <p><i>Client.</i> Oh, that is delightful! Because you see
        with the carriages and the opera-box— And that
        reminds me, I think I shall give up the opera-box. Do you
        know last Season the music was magnificent, but quite too
        learned. I think— (<i>Gives her views at great length

        taking up your time.</p>

        <p><i>Sol.</i> Not at all. I have nothing particular to do,
        and our interview comes out of the estate. Now are you sure
        we can do nothing for you this morning? The last time you
        were here we got copies of all the orders for you. I hope
        you received them safely.</p>

        <p><i>Client</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Why, I do not think I
        have opened the packet! I came across a bundle the other
        day, and could not make out what it was, and laid it aside,
        because I saw your name upon it and thought it must have
        something to do with that troublesome Chancery suit.</p>

        <p><i>Sol.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Well, my dear Madam, that
        parcel represented several pounds. However, it doesn’t
        matter; you won’t have to pay for it, as it will come out
        of the estate. And now, what can we do for you? Have you
        looked into the accounts carefully?</p>

        <p><i>Client.</i> No, and I am rather fond of figures.</p>

        <p><i>Sol.</i> Then we will send you a copy for, say, the
        last five years.</p>

        <p><i>Client.</i> Shall I be able to make them out?</p>

        <p><i>Sol.</i> You ought to be able to do so, my dear
        Madam. They will be prepared by a leading firm of
        Accountants, and we will check them ourselves before we
        send them to you. Is there anything else?</p>

        <p><i>Client.</i> No thanks—I think not. And now I
        must say good-bye. I am ashamed to take up so much of your
        valuable time.</p>

        <p><i>Sol.</i> Not at all. I shall be amply remunerated out
        of the estate. (<i>Exit</i> Client. Solicitor <i>gives

    “a little treasure” to an Operatic Manager. MASCAGNI’s
    <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> was the second course to-night, in
    which this adaptable lady, the <i>Cupid</i> of the first piece,
    appeared as old heart-broken grey-haired <i>Lucia</i>, the
    mother of the gay <i>Turiddu</i>. Were Sir AUGUSTUS inclined to
    introduce a little light English jocosity into this serious
    Opera, he might give a line to the implacable <i>Alfio</i>,

    the best night of the Season. To-night BAUERMEISTER appears as

    Peasant woman, <i>Frascita</i>, a Brigand’s Young Woman; and

    <div class='chapter'><h2>LADY GAY’S DETECTION.</h2></div>

    <p><i>Berkeley Square, W.</i></p>

    <p>MR. PUNCH, Sir,</p>

    <p>I am surprised to find a Journal of your standing lowering
    itself to follow the example of the so-called “Society
    Journals” by inserting contributions from women!—I have
    discovered, no matter how, that My Wife, who always declares
    she hates letter-writing, has for months past contributed a
    long weekly letter to <i>Punch</i>, dealing with racing from a
    humorous (save the mark!) point of view! Now I never make jokes
    myself—at least intentionally—nor do I think it
    becomes a man of position to do so—and I quite agree with
    SWIFT or SHERIDAN (I know it was <i>one</i> of these infernal
    clever literary chaps) who said, “A humorous woman is a
    delusion and a snare!”—so you may imagine my disgust at
    finding My Wife writing for a Journal!—why couldn’t she
    have asked Me to help her?—and signing her articles
    anonymously too!—for I need hardly tell you she is no
    more “GAY” than I am!—at all events when in <i>my</i>
    society!</p>

    <p>Like most busy idlers (that is <i>not</i> intended for a
    joke)—I go racing a bit, and of course “have a bit on”
    like other people, and having tried all the turf-prophets in
    turn, with unsatisfactory results, I was delighted to hear from
    a friend that “a new DANIEL had come to judgment” in the person
    of a tipster on <i>Punch</i>, who was “wonderful
    good”—(it was just the time when she <i>did</i> blunder
    on to a winner)—and I made up my mind to follow the new
    Prophet DANIEL; but, by Jove! it resulted in a loss, and DANIEL
    landed me among the lions in no time! These are <i>not</i>
    jokes, but sober facts—I plunged heavily on all the
    “Selections,” and am now in the pleasant position of owing the
    Ring a substantial sum in addition to “the old,” through
    following My Wife’s advice—whilst <i>her</i>
    banking-account is considerably augmented through having
    <i>laid against</i> her own tips! This <i>may</i> be humorous,
    but as i said, I don’t approve of humour when exercised on
    myself!</p>

    <p>I laughed most consumedly at some of her articles, but on
    looking them over again—(she has kept the lot, pasted in
    a book—a monument to my fatuity!)—I don’t think so
    much of them now I know she wrote them, and see that I could
    have made numberless valuable suggestions had she only seen fit
    to consult me! Of course I could stop any further contribution
    on her part, but consideration for your readers (?) prevents
    that—to say nothing of <i>her</i> determination to
    continue—so I have therefore consented to her odd whim,
    on the condition that in future I “edit” her
    contributions;—I need hardly assure you that I shall
    confine my “editing” strictly to these limits, and that your
    own Editor need be under no apprehension as to my usurping his
    place,—ably as I should, no doubt, fill it!</p>

    <p>My Wife begs me to follow her example, and conclude with a
    verse—(I don’t know where she picked up such a bad
    habit)—but—while bowing to her wishes—(I am
    always polite)—to a certain extent, I absolutely decline
    to make the verse other than <i>blank</i>!</p>
